## About the Developer 👩🏻‍💻🤓

My name is Clàudia and I'm from Barcelona. I decided to participate solo in this project because I wanted to challenge myself and practice my skills.💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 Additionally, since I work, it is much more convenient for me to manage the project on my own. 
I am a student pursuing a higher degree in web and multiplatform development. I have also completed a full-stack bootcamp and a Java backend bootcamp as part of my prior experience.📚

## My Experience with Codedex-Hackathon 🤔

I had a fantastic time working on this project.🥳🥳🥳 It has been a great experience that I would love to repeat, even though there were moments of frustration. I was able to overcome all the issues that arose. In the past, I participated in a hackathon, but I did not enjoy that experience. However, I found this hackathon to be delightful and fulfilling.🫶🏻


### Have an amazing day! <img src="http://37.media.tumblr.com/44d4fb34d7d9a0407c8fd5520e2c3123/tumblr_nago0vkGOD1tbhv9ro1_500.gif" width="40">
