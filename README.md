## About the Developer

My name is Clàudia and I am from Barcelona. I decided to participate solo in this project because I wanted to challenge myself and practice my skills. Additionally, since I work, it is much more convenient for me to manage the project on my own. I am a student pursuing a higher degree in web and multiplatform development. I have also completed a full-stack bootcamp and a Java backend bootcamp as part of my prior experience.

## My Experience

I had a fantastic time working on this project. It has been a great experience that I would love to repeat, even though there were moments of frustration. I was able to overcome all the issues that arose. In the past, I participated in a hackathon, but I did not enjoy that experience. However, I found this hackathon to be delightful and fulfilling.
